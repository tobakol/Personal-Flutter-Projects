# native_features_and_storage

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a google maps application, which enables the user explore, obtain, edit and store information about desired locations.


The app makes use of native app features like camera, location and device storage. 
The application implements google maps, so you will need to generate an api key from the google developer account available to you. Don't worry, it's free.
Insert the api key in the required spots in the following files

-ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift

-android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml

-lib/services/location_service.dart
